  explanation: |
    The National Youth Orchestras of the Netherlands (NJON), the organisation behind, among others, the Nationaal Jeugd Orkest (NJO), Jeugdorkest Nederland (JON) and the NJO Muziekzomer, received a negative BIS-advice from the Dutch Council for Culture concerning their basic infrastructure funding 2021-2024. The advice contains several erroneous arguments and therefore the NJON has formally objected. Given the role of the council towards the government, the current advice harms the organisation of NJON and might endanger the continuity of the NJON.

    Time to act! This website offers a platform for the people that do regard NJON as the place for education and participation for young musicians with a musical dream. Let’s support NJON’s objection as a collective!
