  explanation: |
    The National Youth Orchestras of the Netherlands (NJON), the organisation behind, among others, the Nationaal Jeugd Orkest (NJO), Jeugdorkest Nederland (JON) and the NJO Muziekzomer, received a negative BIS-advice from the Dutch Council for Culture concerning their basic infrastructure funding 2021-2024. The advice contains several erroneous arguments and therefore the NJON has formally objected. Given the role and influence of the council, the advice can endanger the indispensable financial support from other organisations. This situation will put the continuity of NJON at risk.

    Time to act! This website offers a platform for the people that do regard NJON as the place for education and participation for young musicians with a musical dream. Let’s support NJON’s objection as a collective!
